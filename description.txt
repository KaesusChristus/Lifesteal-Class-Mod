Lifesteal Class - Alpha Version v0.1

Welcome to the Lifesteal Class Mod – a custom damage class focused on sickles, scythes, and blood-based magic-like weapons.
This mod introduces only the new damage class, so you can easily add it to a vanilla-like playthrough without major changes.


Core Features:

Lifesteal Weapons – Mostly sickles and scythes that heal you on true melee hits. Most of them also have unique effects, special projectiles, or other abilities.
Fractalite Staffs – Magic-like weapons that consume your health instead of mana. These weapons encourage you to play at high health, combining risk and strategy.
Health over Defense – Players using this class are more likely to gain extra max life rather than defense.
		      Some effects and accessories scale with your current or maximum life, creating unique builds.


How Lifesteal Works

On critical hits, a Lifesteal weapon will heal you for 5% of the damage dealt.
For example: if you crit for 64 damage, you heal for 3 HP (rounded down).
This system is still being balanced and may change in future updates!
There are also alot of items that can heal you in other ways.

Important!

Lifesteal healing currently works on dummies for testing purposes only.
Please disregard this behavior — it’s not intended for actual gameplay.
As this is still an alpha version in active development, such effects may not
reflect the final design.

Other Items:	7 crafting materials

Bosses: 	Currently not planned
Sprites: 	Basic or placeholder (I'm not an expert at pixel art yet)

The following Items has now Lifestealdamage instead of the standard damagetype:

Bonehelm


Development Info

This is my first mod, and I'm still learning C# and the tModLoader framework.
Damage and healing values may be unbalanced right now.
I’d love any kind of feedback, bug reports, or suggestions from players trying out this alpha version!


Want to Help? (Sprite Artists!)

If you're a pixel artist and would like to contribute voluntarily (no payment involved), I'd be super grateful!
All contributors will be credited as sprite designers in the mod.
You're also welcome to submit your own custom vanity outfit, and I’ll happily add it to the mod — possibly with a secret in-game way to obtain it!
Sprite sharing and communication will happen via Discord (chat only).

Sprite Guidelines for Basic Items

File format: .png
The canvas size should exactly match the sprite’s dimensions (e.g. 64×64 px for a 64×64 item) –
do not upscale to larger canvases like 512×512 or 1024×1024.
Use a transparent background for any empty space (no solid colors).
Important:

If you're submitting animated items or equipment sprites (like armor or vanity sets),
the sprite size may differ depending on the number of frames.
For example: a 4-frame item animation would be 16×64 px (4 frames stacked vertically).
Player-attached gear like helmets, chestplates, or wings must follow Terraria's equipment sprite standards (usually 18×18 or 20×20 per frame, depending on type).

Please follow the vanilla Terraria style – clean, readable, and not overly detailed.
Like Thorium, not Calamity.
